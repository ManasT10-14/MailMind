Implement Batching, Implement pre agent layer

created the schema for router agent 
next is the brain part of it witht the deciding the input to the router agent and the rolling summary part



pipelines get email function is not updated as in the testing.ipynb the timestamp is datetime.datetime so cure that and then test router agent from testing.ipynb first and there is  a doubt that the send will work or not in the router agent if all good move to the next agents.



Now move towards the defer agent

practice the memory part with postgres and then Implement it in the defer agent's create watch from the defer subbgraphs nodes.

=============================================================


wiring of defer agent remains, can be done easily
for the draft and calendar agent the llm calling is completed but the actual action part like sending via gmail api and logging in calndar using calendar api remain.
This is will be done in parent graph starting tommorow

wire the parent graph then come back to the defer agent's call_router node and finish it by calling the parent node that has the execution of the router note

for the draft and calendar agent the llm calling is completed but the actual action part like sending via gmail api and logging in calndar using calendar api remain.
This is will be done in parent graph starting tommorow

wiring of defer agent remains, can be done easily
